{{/*
Role + RoleBinding, and optionally ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding.

Centralised on evidence: 104 of the 123 charts that ship RBAC had an identical pair.

Rules come from values and default to EMPTY, deliberately: an empty Role grants
nothing, so a chart that has not declared its rules cannot silently acquire
permissions it never asked for.

The ClusterRoleBinding name carries the namespace, because cluster-scoped names are
GLOBAL -- two releases of the same chart in different namespaces would otherwise
fight over one object and the second install would steal the first one's binding.
